It also needs a change from f to fn in the line below.\r\n\r\nIn many other places in the world fn is used as shorthand for function.\r\nDoes changing to f add value here? especially when there are no explicit \r\nparameters?\r\n\r\nAgreed, that in the overall scheme of things this is in the atto-cosm.\r\nIt just jumped out at me as I was trying to understand the changes which are the\r\nintent of this PR.",

        "body" : "Looks like this `fix` was added by mistake, I'll remove this. Only thing to which it would give some additional value might be using scaladoc - I'm not sure about this one, but I think scaladoc might throw some errors as there is no `fn` param, but `f` instead. Anyway such changes (targeting scaladoc) should go to seperate PR, e.g fixing #1121 ",
